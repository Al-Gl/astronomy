## Additional Required Elements

### FAQ Questions (6 required)
1. [ ] **Can I see galaxies through binoculars?** Yes, but manage expectations - gray smudges not spiral arms. M31, M81/M82 accessible.
2. [ ] **What's the best binocular size for deep sky objects?** 10x50 all-around best, 7x50 for wide fields, 15x70 for detail. Aperture more important than magnification.
3. [ ] **How dark do skies need to be for deep sky observing?** Depends on object type. Open clusters work under city skies; galaxies need Bortle 4 or better.
4. [ ] **What can I realistically expect to see through binoculars vs photos?** Photos show color and detail impossible visually. Expect gray smudges, not vibrant colors. Most objects appear small and subtle.
5. [ ] **Why do deep sky objects look gray and colorless?** Human eyes' rods (night vision) don't perceive color in faint light. Only brightest objects (Orion Nebula) show faint greenish tint.
6. [ ] **What's the difference between open and globular clusters in binoculars?** Open clusters resolve into individual stars; globular clusters appear as fuzzy round patches with brighter centers, only partially resolved in larger binoculars.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Create article structure** with all 14 sections, headers, IDs
2. **Write Introduction** setting expectations and scope
3. **Write seasonal tours** (Winter, Spring, Summer, Autumn) with full target data
4. **Create info boxes** with target lists and reference data
5. **Write remaining sections** (equipment, techniques, Messier, etc.)
6. **Write FAQ section** with 6 detailed answers
7. **Add all schema markup** (BreadcrumbList, TechArticle, FAQPage)
8. **Copy CSS and JavaScript** exactly from template
9. **Quality check**: word count, accuracy, completeness
10. **Final review**: realistic expectations emphasized throughout
