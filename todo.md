# Todo: Redesign Homepage to Be More Unique and "Spacy"

## Problem
Current design looks generic and "like some cheap AI website". Needs to be more unique and distinctively space-themed.

## Root Issues with Current Design
- [ ] Emoji icons (🔭, ✨, 📡) feel cheap and placeholder-like
- [ ] Standard centered grid layout is conventional
- [ ] Basic glassmorphism has become too common
- [ ] Static starfield lacks depth and movement
- [ ] Card hover effects are generic

## Redesign Plan

### 1. Replace Emoji Icons with Custom SVG Space Graphics
- [ ] Create custom SVG icon for Observatory (telescope with stars)
- [ ] Create custom SVG icon for Celestial Catalog (constellation map)
- [ ] Create custom SVG icon for Cosmic Chronicles (shooting star/comet)
- [ ] Style SVGs with gradients and glow effects

### 2. Create More Dynamic Starfield
- [ ] Add multiple starfield layers with different speeds (parallax effect)
- [ ] Include shooting stars animation
- [ ] Add subtle nebula/cosmic dust effect with color gradients

### 3. Redesign Card Layout for Uniqueness
- [ ] Change from standard grid to orbital/asymmetric positioning
- [ ] Add cosmic rays or connection lines between cards
- [ ] Implement staggered reveal animations on scroll

### 4. Enhanced Glassmorphism
- [ ] Add more pronounced blur with color tinting
- [ ] Implement edge glow effects (simulating atmosphere)
- [ ] Add subtle inner shadows for depth

### 5. Make Hero More Visually Striking
- [ ] Add animated cosmic particles around title
- [ ] Implement text shadow with multiple layers for depth
- [ ] Add subtle pulse/breathing animation to subtitle

### 6. Additional Space-Themed Touches
- [ ] Add orbital rings or planet silhouettes in background
- [ ] Implement cursor-following parallax effect
- [ ] Add lens flare effect on key elements

## Implementation Order
1. Start with custom SVG icons (biggest visual impact)
2. Enhance starfield animation (foundation improvement)
3. Redesign card layout and positioning
4. Add enhanced glassmorphism and effects
5. Upgrade hero section visuals
6. Final polish with additional space touches
